\subsection*{Summary}
I am a recent Master's graduate in Computer Science, and having defended my master's thesis with honors, 
I am now looking to step into a formal role where I can apply my coding- and 
academic skills in an area that matters.

In the last several years, I have increasingly been getting involved in complex
projects in fields, I haven't necessarily worked with before. In particular, I thrive with tasks related to
research, development and problem solving, and I make an effort of delivering
tangible and quantifiable results.\\
My practical experience shows this, by having a 100\% implemented success rate of products
in both student jobs and academic projects, always backing up my results with
data and benchmarks.

As a person I am outgoing and sociable, and I enjoy contributing to my
workplace professionally as well as socially, in example by arranging after-hours social
events.

I am looking forward to becoming part of a talented team of highly capable
colleagues in a high skill ceiling environment, where I can partake in solving high
complexity tasks, as well as hone myself professionally by learning from the
best.

\subsection*{Professional experience}
% \textbf{Software engineer at Rehfeld Medical} \textit{(February 2019 --)}
%   \begin{itemize}[topsep=0pt]
%   \item Implementing

\textbf{Backend developer at June by Danske Bank} \textit{(March 2017 -- February 2019)}
  \begin{itemize}[topsep=0pt]
  \item Primary responsible the current design and
  implementation of our image recognition engine, which is used for
  verifying customer identity documents during our customer onboarding
  \textit{KYC}\footnote{Know Your Customer; in other words the step of verifying a
    customer's identity.} process, increasing from 56\% to \textasciitilde 92\%.

\textbf{Teaching Assistant at The University of Copenhagen} \textit{(September 2017 -- November 2017)}
\begin{itemize}[topsep=0pt]
\item 
  Teaching assistant on the \textit{Advanced Programming} master's course, where
  I have had the responsibility for preparing and hosting weekly lab sessions
  for my assigned class of students, in addition to correcting, grading and
  giving feedback on weekly assignments.
\item
  The role included final grading of the \textit{Advanced Programming}
  exam submissions.
\end{itemize}

  In \textit{Advanced Programming}, I taught the languages Haskell, Prolog and
  Erlang.

\subsection*{Education}
\textbf{MSc in Computer Science at The University of Copenhagen} \textit{(August 2016 -- January 2019)}\\
  During my master's program, I have focused on courses covering compilers,
  logic, semantics and type theory, and functional and parallel programming,
  including GPGPU\footnote{General Purpose Graphics Processing Unit} programming.

  For my thesis \textit{FShark: Futhark programming in
    FSharp}\footnote{\url{https://futhark-lang.org/student-projects/mikkel-msc-thesis.pdf}},
  my two biggest contributions was the design and implementation of a C\# backend for
  the Futhark compiler, and the design and implementation of an F\#-to-Futhark transpiler.
  The C\# backend has since become part of the official Futhark compiler, and is
  now enabling developers to effortlessly integrate high-performance GPU powered
  computational kernels in standard .NET projects.

  My thesis was given the grade \textit{12} at the defense, corresponding to
  an A on the international ECTS scale.
  
\textbf{BSc in Computer Science at The University of Copenhagen} \textit{(August 2012 -- June 2016)}\\
  For my finishing bachelor's project, I extended the Futhark language with type
  aliases, and described a complete design for implementing ML-style higher-order modules.

\textbf{General Certificate of Secondary Education (STX) at Viborg Gymnasium \& HF} \textit{(Finished 2010)}\\
  With a focus on social sciences, English and mathematics.

\subsection*{Skill summary}
Here follows a summary of the languages and technologies that I am experienced in,
and can confidently work with:\\
APL, Bash/Linux, Assembly, C, C++, C\#, CUDA, Elm, Elixir, F\#, Go, Haskell,
Java, JavaScript, Matlab, Node.js, Numpy, OpenCL, OpenCV, Python (2 \& 3),
Standard ML, SQL and Tesseract OCR.

Amazon Web Services, Azure, Benchmarking, DSL design and -implementation, Docker, functional
programming, Git, GPGPU programming, Jenkins, Octopus, SCRUM/agile development,
Test-Driven Development, Travis, parallel programming, property-based testing og
project management using Jira.

I am a competent English speaker and -writer, and am used to work in an
international environment.

\subsection*{About me}
I have been a political activist since 2009, working with both student-, LGBTQ-
and national politics, and I am currently a member and the treasurer of
Enhedslistens Queer Committee.

My spare time is spent on my friends and hobbies: I have large interest in music,
and I play guitar and bass at the amateur level.
In general, I love using the city and it's nightlife, and I am an avid concert- and
cinema-goer. I have spent my time on student revues for the last five years, primarily as a writer
and director, but also on-stage as a singer/actor.

Finally, I also enjoy cycling, video games and cooking.
